# CLP methodology

**Version:** [clp-0.5.1]

**File with Formatted Queries:** [Config File]

## Setup

The benchmark builds on the public [CLP core Ubuntu-Jammy] Docker image.

We use the `clp-s` binary, which is a variant of CLP optimized for semi-structured logs like JSON.
We run `clp-s` with a target encoded size of 256 MB, balancing compression ratio with search speed.
Increasing the target encoded size can yield even better compression results. Additional tuning
options are documented in the [user docs].

Before calling `clp-s`, create a directory for its output files and pass it as a parameter to the
ingestion and search commands.

CLP doesnâ€™t maintain any internal caches, so we only flush the filesystem buffers and clear the
filesystem caches before each query.
