# How to Add a Dataset

The simplest way to add a new dataset is to,

1) Add a new directory under [data](/data) with your dataset's name.   
2) Copy a metadata.yaml file from any other dataset directory under data and fill in the correct information. The number of lines doesnâ€™t matter for the downloading process.You can fill that value in after it is downloaded.  
3) Run the [download\_all.py](/scripts/download_all.py) script.
